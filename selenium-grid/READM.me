# Selenium Grid dockerized

- Selenium Grid is used to run our tests on different OS/browsers in parallel.
It basically uses master-slaves (or hub-nodes) concept â€“
where there is one master/hub
and there are few slaves/nodes registered to the master/hub.
When we send our tests to the master/hub for execution,
based on the browser/OS requirements of the test,
master will route the request to the appropriate nodes and get them executed.

## services (containers that will be created)
- selenium-hub Setup Selenium Hub
- chrome/firevos Setup nodes with Chrome & Firefox and register to the hub
